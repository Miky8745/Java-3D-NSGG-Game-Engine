# Java 3D Game Engine

This project is a custom-built 3D game engine developed in Java. Despite being an early project with just 3 months of Java experience, it represents a significant step in my learning journey.

## Installation

To install and run the game engine:

1. Ensure that you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `EngineBuild/libs` directory.
3. Double-click the `.jar` file to run the engine.
